## Motivation

DevResume helps developers and technical people to write their resume instead of wrestling with menus.
The configuration is based on a subset of the [JSON resume standard](https://jsonresume.org/). It includes only the actually useful parts of it. The best practices are already taken care based on the recommendations from the book [The Tech Resume Inside Out](https://thetechresume.com/). You are free to focus on what matters.

## Scripts

#### `npm run dev`
